# üöï Taxi-Service üöñ

Taxi-service is a **simple** web-application that includes **registration**, **authentication**, and a user interface for drivers.

## ‚≠êÔ∏è Functionality:

- Registration like a driver
- Authentication like a driver
- Manage drivers (create, update, remove)
- Manage manufacturers (create, update, remove)
- Manage cars (create, update, remove)
- Display lists of cars, manufacturers, and drivers
- Associate drivers with cars
- View a list of cars for the authenticated driver

## üìÇ Project Structure:

The project follows a **Three-Tier Architecture**, consisting of the following layers:
- Dao - Responsible for querying and manipulating data in the database.
- Service - Orchestrates the interaction between the DAO layer and the controller layer.
- controler - Accepts requests from clients, processes them using the service layer, and sends responses back.

The project use following structure of derictories:
##main package 
- **Controller** - this layer is responsible for processing HTTP requests and returning an HTTP responses.
- **dao** - this leyer is responsible for working with the database.
- **exception** - here we store all custom exceptions that we use in application.
- **model** - here we have basic rolles that application work with.
- **service** - all business logic of the project is concentrated here.
- **util** - here we create connection for DB and set JDBC properties:

- **web.filter** - we use this filter to verify user authentication.
- **resources** - this directory store two files: **init_db** (this file stores a script for creating a database with the corresponding tables that are needed for) and **log4j2.xml** (configuration file for logger).
- **webapp** - this directory stores file **web.xml** ((configuration file for controlers and filters), and all needed JSP files for displaying an application in browser and simple styles for them.
