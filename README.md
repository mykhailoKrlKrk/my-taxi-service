- Authentication like a driver
- Manage drivers (create, update, remove)
- Manage manufacturers (create, update, remove)
- Car Management: Conveniently handle cars (create, update, remove).
- List Displays: Instantly access lists of cars, manufacturers, and drivers.
- Driver-Car Association: Link drivers with specific cars.
- Personalized Car List: View a curated list of cars assigned to the authenticated driver.

## üìÇ Project Structure

The project employs a **Three-Tier Architecture**, consisting of these layers:

### 1. DAO Layer
- Responsible for efficient querying and manipulation of database data.

### 2. Service Layer
- Orchestrates interactions between the DAO and controller layers.
- Implements critical business logic for seamless functionality.

### 3. Controller Layer
- Accepts client requests and efficiently handles API interactions.

Additionally, the project follows a structured organization with the following directories:

- **Controller**: Processes HTTP requests and sends HTTP responses.
- **DAO**: Handles database interactions.
- **Exception**: Stores custom exceptions used in the application.
- **Model**: Contains core application entities.
- **Service**: Concentrates application's business logic.
- **Util**: Establishes database connections and configures JDBC properties:

- **Web.filter**: Utilizes filters for user authentication verification.
- **Resources**: Stores important files, including the `init_db.sql` script for database setup and `log4j2.xml` for logger configuration.
- **Webapp**: Holds the `web.xml` configuration file for controllers and filters, along with necessary JSP files and styles for browser display.
